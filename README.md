# Functional regulation of bilayer lipid composition on AQP

Scripts for processing and analyzing trajectory files

## Features-and-MSM
Contains scripts and example files to perform distance feature selection from trajectory information, then use the final feature set to construct and validate Markov State Models.

## Minima-traj-analysis
Contains scripts to select frames from a minima of the energy landscape and perform analyses on them.

## Continuous-traj-analysis
Contains scripts for time-dependent analyses, such as water and lipid residence time on a 5000 frame continous trajectory in a energy landscape minima.
