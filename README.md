# Functional regulation of AQP by lipid bilayer composition

Scripts for processing and analyzing AMBER .xtc trajectory files

## Features-and-MSM
Contains scripts to perform distance feature selection from trajectory information, then use the final feature set to construct and validate Markov State Models.

## Minima-traj-analysis
Contains scripts to select 1300-2000 frames from a minima of the energy landscape and scripts to perform analyses on them (pore radius, pore plug diheral, hydrophobic mismatch).

## Continuous-traj-analysis
Contains scripts for time-dependent analyses, such as water and lipid residence time on a 5000 frame (50 ns) continous trajectory in a energy landscape minima.
