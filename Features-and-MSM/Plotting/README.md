Scripts used for plotting MSM-related figures for each membrane system. All scripts require all MSM-objects and feature .pkl files, which can be found on Box (organized by lipid bilayer systems).

- [plot-its-ck-featcorr.py](plot-its-ck-featcorr.py) generates the implied timescale plots, Chapman-Kolgomorov test plots, and Feature-tICs correlation plots.
- [plot-reweighting.py](plot-reweighting.py) generates raw vs. MSM-weighted cluster distribution plots.
- [plot-tICS.py](plot-tICS.py) calculates the relative free energy of each microstate and projects them onto the tIC space. MSM-weighted (stationary-distribution-weighted) free energy landscapes are then generated.
